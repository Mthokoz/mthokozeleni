        I possess a diverse set of skills ranging from software development, business analysis, fieldwork experience in data collection and event organisation.
      I hold a BSc in Computer Science and Business Computing from the University of Cape Town.
      Where I participated in academic and personal projects in software development such as the District Six AR, a mobile development project and a web application which have been used in research projects and are being further improved.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also participated in Business analysis projects where we analysed and improved business processes and bridged the gap between business needs and technical solutions for UCT Finance operations debtors office and the Information Systems department.
        In my undertaking of these projects I have experienced various IT project management styles such Agile/Scrum for software development and applying design thinking in solving business challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        My personal work experiences at Citizen Surveys and Stats Sa Census22  exposed me to practical project fieldwork experience in data collection and analysis, administrative work and fieldwork supervision and experience at Bluenote Soundz  an entrepreneurial venture exposed me to event organisation,field and social media marketing and promotion.
        The intersection of my diverse skills and experiences I believe puts me in an advantageous  position as I kickstart my career in tech.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have technical and analytical skills required to pursue Software Development (Mobile, Web and Database Development, Software testing),  Business Analysis, IT Technical Support  and I have the organisational and interpersonal skills for IT and non-IT Project Management , Project administration and Fieldwork Coordination/Supervision.
        My goal is for an entry role or an internship in any of these fields, which I will then dedicate myself to learning and growing in that field with an organisation that aligns with my vision.
